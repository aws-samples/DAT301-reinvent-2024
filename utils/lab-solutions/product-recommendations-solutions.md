## Part 1: Database Structure Solutions

### ü§î Question #1: TEXT[] vs. Junction Table
**Why use TEXT[] for category_preferences instead of a junction table?**

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Current approach using TEXT[]
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    preference_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    category_preferences TEXT[],
    -- other fields...
);

-- Alternative approach with junction table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    category_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE user_category_preferences (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(category_id),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, category_id)
);
```

**Trade-offs Analysis:**
1. **TEXT[] Approach**
   - ‚úÖ Pros:
     - Simpler queries for reading preferences
     - Faster retrieval (single table access)
     - More flexible for user-specific category names
     - Easier to update all preferences at once
   - ‚ùå Cons:
     - No referential integrity for categories
     - More complex to query individual categories
     - Potential data inconsistency

2. **Junction Table Approach**
   - ‚úÖ Pros:
     - Maintains referential integrity
     - Better for category analytics
     - Normalized design
   - ‚ùå Cons:
     - More complex queries
     - Multiple joins needed
     - Higher query overhead

**Choice Rationale:** TEXT[] was chosen for simplicity and performance in this case, as the category list is relatively stable and the primary use case is reading all preferences at once.

## Part 2: Search Methods Solutions

### üß™ Query Test Results

1. **"Wireless blutooth headfones" (misspelled query)**

**Keyword Search Results:**
```sql
-- Low relevance due to exact match failure
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
    SELECT "productId"
    FROM bedrock_integration.product_catalog
    WHERE to_tsvector('english', product_description) @@ 
          plainto_tsquery('english', 'Wireless blutooth headfones')
) subq;
-- Returns: 0 matches
```

**Semantic Search Results:**
```python
# High relevance despite misspellings
query_embedding = generate_embedding("Wireless blutooth headfones")
results = similarity_search(query_embedding, top_k=3)

# Sample results:
# 1. "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Noise Cancellation" (similarity: 0.92)
# 2. "Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds with Charging Case" (similarity: 0.89)
# 3. "Premium Wireless Over-Ear Headphones" (similarity: 0.85)
```

2. **"Something to keep my drinks cold"**

**Keyword Search Results:**
```sql
-- Limited matches due to literal interpretation
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
    SELECT "productId"
    FROM bedrock_integration.product_catalog
    WHERE to_tsvector('english', product_description) @@ 
          plainto_tsquery('english', 'Something to keep my drinks cold')
) subq;
-- Returns: Very few or no exact matches
```

**Semantic Search Results:**
```python
# Understanding intent and context
query_embedding = generate_embedding("Something to keep my drinks cold")
results = similarity_search(query_embedding, top_k=3)

# Sample results:
# 1. "Insulated Cooler Bag with Shoulder Strap" (similarity: 0.88)
# 2. "Portable Mini Fridge for Travel" (similarity: 0.85)
# 3. "Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Water Bottle" (similarity: 0.82)
```

## Part 3: LLM Prompt Enhancement Solutions

### üéÆ Enhanced Prompt Templates

1. **Price-Sensitive Recommendations:**
```python
recommendations_prompt = f"""
Based on the user's preferences: "{user_preferences}"
And considering these products: {results.to_dict('records')}

Please provide {top_k} personalized recommendations while:
1. Strictly adhering to the user's budget constraints
2. Prioritizing best value-for-money options
3. Including both premium and budget alternatives when appropriate
4. Explaining price-performance trade-offs
5. Highlighting any ongoing deals or discounts

For each recommendation, explain:
- Why it provides good value
- How it compares to higher/lower priced alternatives
- Long-term cost considerations (durability, maintenance)
"""
```

2. **Seasonal Recommendations:**
```python
recommendations_prompt = f"""
Based on the user's preferences: "{user_preferences}"
And considering these products: {results.to_dict('records')}
Current season: {current_season}
Upcoming season: {next_season}

Please provide {top_k} personalized recommendations while:
1. Prioritizing season-appropriate items
2. Suggesting versatile products for seasonal transitions
3. Considering regional weather patterns
4. Including both immediate and upcoming seasonal needs
5. Highlighting seasonal features and benefits

"""
```

3. **Brand Preference-Aware:**
```python
recommendations_prompt = f"""
Based on the user's preferences: "{user_preferences}"
Previous purchases: {purchase_history}
Brand interactions: {brand_interactions}
Available products: {results.to_dict('records')}

Please provide {top_k} personalized recommendations while:
1. Considering previously purchased brands
2. Suggesting similar brands in style/quality
3. Balancing brand loyalty with product quality
4. Including mix of familiar and new brands
